Hello everyone! 👋

I’ve recently graduated with a degree in **Biology** 🧬 and I’m actively seeking new opportunities in the **tech** 💻 and **bioinformatics** 🔬 fields. My journey in bioinformatics has sparked a deep interest in combining my background in biology with the power of technology to solve complex problems.

Currently, I’m expanding my skill set by learning **web development** 🌐 using **JavaScript**, **Node.js**, and **Angular**. I’m also proficient in **HTML** and **CSS** 🎨, and I’ve used **RStudio** extensively for **statistical analysis** 📊 during my studies. Additionally, I’m proficient in **Linux** 🐧 and **Git** for version control, ensuring efficient workflow management and smooth development processes.

I’m eager to contribute to innovative projects and am open to full-time positions or internships in tech, bioinformatics, or related fields. You can find my **CV** and **GitHub** portfolio linked below:
